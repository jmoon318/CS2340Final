    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The project "GreenPlate: A Sustainable Food Management System" is dedicated to promoting sustainable eating and shopping habits.
             Its design focuses on reducing food waste and promoting efficient resource use.
             GreenPlate enables users to actively contribute to a sustainable lifestyle by tracking daily calorie intake, creating recipes, managing ingredient quantities, and generating shopping lists.
              It provides actionable insights into recipes, ingredients, and purchasing needs for upcoming meals, thus improving grocery shopping, diet management, and daily food preparation.

        <h2>Design & Architecture</h2>
        <p>The architectural design of GreenPlate is structured to support a robust and scalable food management system.
            The application implements design patterns such as Singleton and Strategy to enhance flexibility and maintainability. 
            Key architectural components include a user authentication system using Firebase, a database for recipes, ingredients, and meal tracking, and synchronized operations between user inputs and database updates.
            UML diagrams provide a visual representation of the systemâ€™s architecture, emphasizing the interaction between different classes and the flow of data.
